“The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”
— Albert Einstein

Every day we have thousands of thoughts swirling in our head. Thinking plays an important part in our life. It can make us or it can break us. It can be challenging to maintain clarity amongst all those different thoughts and easy to fall prey to negative thought patterns and stay prisoners of our thoughts.

In an age of rapidly accelerating technology, where man and machine are united, thinking is going to remain a critical advantage in order to have an edge. For example, the most successful chess players are those who play with the machine. They know how to think in a structured way and translate those thoughts into action.

The purpose of this part is to provide food for thought on how to structure your thinking, develop equanimity — which equates to mental calmness — and build an independent spirit. We will learn how to be better thinkers. This part awaits your judgment and only serves as a stepping stone for you to dive deeper into your own thought patterns. The more we can be aware of our own internal dialog, the more we can act against the negative thoughts that bring us down.
