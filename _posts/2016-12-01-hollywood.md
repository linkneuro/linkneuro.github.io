When was a young kid growing up in Germany, I told my mom that one day in the future, "I'll be starring in Hollywood!" I was very confident about this and still think about this early childhood inclination often as I never made it as an actor in a major way.

The reason was probably two-fold: First, I didn't think it was possible because growing up in Germany I didn't think I had what it takes and second, Hollywood seemed far away. Ultimately, my many other interests pulled me away from acting and perhaps the lack of autonomy in deciding which role one could play deterred me from giving this a shot.

And so I become an actor of life, doing my best to learn acting skills on the side and applying the lessons to my life as an artist. I figured even if I wouldn't become an actor on stage or film, the skill of acting would help me to become a better communicator and public speaker. During my time in New York, I took acting classes at [The Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute](https://www.methodactingstrasberg.com/) and learned method acting. I continued my acting education when I studied in London by taking improv classes and doing standup. I continued on this path of learning it as a skill and applying it to everything else that I was doing. I love photography and have been collecting photos for a long time. I created a very short film called [*Presence*](/presence) which message was to remind myself and others to stay more in the present

However, having had such a strong inclination to become an actor from an early stage and not pursuing it, I always wondered what the meaning behind this was. Was I actually doing what I meant to do? I was torn between trying to decide if I should just do acting. Perhaps it was more this idea of being an artist and a creator, not necessarily to become an actor, that pulled me to Hollywood, not as a location but as an idea.

Now I have come to understand that growing up with American movies and the many other related fields I pursued gave me an indispensable skill: imagination. Hollywood is about imagination and then certainly extends beyond film. When I lived in Los Angeles, it wasn't to become an actor, but in the spirit of this imagination, it would be fitting that I would end up there after all these years.
