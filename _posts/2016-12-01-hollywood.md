When was a young kid growing up in Germany, I told my mom that one day in the future, "I'll be going to Hollywood!"

This photo that we took on a family vacation in Italy reminded me of my early inclination that was so strong and yet I did not believe that I could do it because of where I was born and how far Hollywood seemed away from me. I thought my accent and lack of English language would prevent me from rising to the top. Ultimately, perhaps I didn't like the lack of autonomy in being cast at the discretion of someone else. 

Nevertheless, I made it an effort to learning acting as a skill as much time as I could give it as I also figured it would help me in my public speaking skills. During my time in New York, I took acting classes at [The Lee Strasberg Theatre & Film Institute](https://www.methodactingstrasberg.com/) and learned method acting. I continued my acting education when I studied in London by taking improv classes and doing standup.

These days, I've tried to embue my acting skill into whatever else I do. 

I created a very short film from my travels in Asia
